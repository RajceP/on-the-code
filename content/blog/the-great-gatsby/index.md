Hello, everyone!

I finally decided to build simple blog based on official [GatsbyJS Boilerplate](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog).

It was really smooth experience so far and I am looking forward to implement some more customization!
The overall performance is great, as expected. The static files are hosted on Netlify.

See you soon!
